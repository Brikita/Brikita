 I am a very dedicated student and a very innovative person. I can also describe myself as a perfectionist. I am aslo eager to learn new things and I like being corrected, I find it better learning from your mistakes. I love teamwork and am quite happy working with other teammates.
 
 I love music very much. I listen to the Hiphop genre mainly, but I also find RnB music quite pleasing as well. I appreciate music of all genres though. Music helps me relax and meditate. I find it very amusing working while listening to music. My G.O.A.T artist is Lil Baby. I also respect other great artists such as Eminem and 50 cent.
